                 <h1>Goats R Us </h1>
                 <H4>By James Delgado-May 9, 2024</h4>

                    <h3> What Is A Goat?</h3>
                    There are three types of domestic goats—those used for dairy
                    , meat and fiber—and more than 200 recognized domestic breed.
                    Some goats are polled, or genetically hornless. Others may 
                    have scimitar- or cor
                    kscrew-type horns, but many are dehorned at an early age to 
                    prevent injury to other goats and handlers. Certain breeds 
                    have straight noses, while others have convex or slightly 
                    dished noses. Their ears may be erect or drooping and vary 
                    in size.
                    heir short or long hair can be curled, silky or coarse. They 
                    may also have beards and wattles on their necks. Goats come 
                    in many colors: solid black, white, red, brown, spotted, two
                    - and three-colored or blended shades. They may also have 
                    facial stripes or black-and-white saddles. Goats’ eyes have 
                    rectangular pupils. Eye color varies, but yellow and brown 
                    are the most common. Goats will often browse at night, and 
                    it is believed that they have excellent night vision.
                    The Zoo exhibits Nigerian dwarf goats. Nigerian dwarf goats
                    were first registered by the International Dairy Goat 
                    Registry in 1981. They are the only true miniature goat 
                    breed of the dairy type and have features similar to those 
                    of other dairy goat breeds, only smaller. Their face is 
                    straight or slightly dished, and their ears are upright and 
                    alert. They have straight, short-to-medium length hair and 
                    come in many colors, the most common being black, brown and 
                    gold. White markings, spots and other color combinations are 
                    also co

                 <h4>Goat and Human Interaction</h4>
                 <p>
                    The domestic variation of these creatures would not exist 
                    without human interaction. Thousands of years ago people 
                    selected and bred only the most docile, friendly, personable 
                    individuals and over many generations the domestication 
                    process occurred.People use and have used these mammals for 
                    a wide variety of purposes. They keep them as pets, breed, 
                    them, show them, use their milk, hide, and meat. Some people 
                    also use them to clear bushes and shrubbery from areas.

                <h4>habits</h4>
                Goats are very social creatures and live in groups called herds,
                which may contain as many as 20 goats in the wild, according to
                National Geographic. Mountain goats are most social during the 
                winter and tend to go solo in the summer. In herds, there is a
                dominant female throughout the year, until mating season. At 
                this time a male dominates the herd. Many times, males only 
                live with a few other males or by themselves, year-round.
                Goats typically spend their days grazing on grasses within their
                home range, which is an area of about 14 square miles 
                (23 square kilometers), according to the ADW. Mountain goats 
                will dig 1 to 1 inch (25 to 50 mm) depressions in the ground to 
                sleep, rest and dust bathe in.
